# Plan-It

## Introduction
Students struggle to find common free time for meetings, events, and social gatherings. However, existing calendar platforms lack functionality for storing and reusing schedules. Our project Plan-It Schedule addresses this gap by providing a platform to:
-   Build and store reusable calendar templates.
  - Create events and see overlapping schedules.
  - Share events with a URL.
